 We will learn here how they work and build model
Ecommerce purchase intention models analyse click-stream consumer
behaviour data from web analytics platforms.
 After analysis it can predict whether a customer will make a purchase
during their visit.
 These online shopping models are used to examine real time web
analytics data and predict the probability of each customer making a
purchase, so the retailer can serve a carefully targeted promotion to try
and persuade those less likely to purchase.
Examining the confusion matrix for the selected model, it shows that we
correctly predicted customers (90%) wouldn’t purchase during their
session, and we correctly predicted that 77% of customers who would
purchase during their sessions.
 Clearly, there’s still more we could do, and the overall accuracy of 88%
 The results show that it’s possible to predict purchase intention from
consumer behaviour data with a good degree of accuracy.
